-------------------

Procinfo contain also two script, lsdev and socklist

Lsdev is a Perl script that attempts to tabulate DMA, IRQ and I/O port
allocation per kernel driver.

Socklist is a Perl script that gives you a list of all open sockets,
enumerating types, port, inode, uid, pid, fd and the program to which
it belongs. Contributed by Larry Doolittle <ldoolitt@jlab.org>.
