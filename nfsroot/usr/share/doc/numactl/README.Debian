numactl for Debian
----------------------

Note the example applications, memhog and numademo, are installed in
/usr/share/doc/numctl/examples.  The upstream source code comes with a
small test suite which is not included in the Debian package.  You may
like to investigate this if you are having problems.

This code is not finalised as yet, so please be sure to report any
bugs or other mis-behaviour.

We ship a static library where upstream does not, see #423182
