                    Experimental dump to CDROMs
                    ===========================

Starting with dump/restore version 0.4b24 or later versions of 
dump/restore you can dump to CDROMs.

You need a (successfully installed) CD-writing software like
  cdrecord (tested with versions 1.11a04 onwards)

These scripts use the new switch ('V') to restore
which signals a multi-volume (non-tape) medium like CDROMs

I have used the shell scripts below to generate/verify the dump

YOU MUST MODIFY these - especially

- adapt FS to the filesystem to be dumped
- UserExit to the path to the user exit function like UserInfo below
- FiFo     to the path to a named pipe (better not on the same filesystem)
- your cd device(s)  ( I have /dev/cdrom a symlink to /dev/sr0 and
                              /dev/cdrw  a symlink to /dev/sr1 )
- your path to cdrecord and
- - cdrecord's dev parameter must be adapted to your CD burner
- - cdrecord's fs (= input fifo size), use less than 64m if you
    are short of memory
- - cdrecord's speed parameter : this parameter not only depends on the
    capabilities of your CD burner BUT also on the speed of your CPU !!!
    With the dump -z6 compression on a 900 MHz Pentium III I had no problems
    with speed=4 which is the maximum speed for my burner.
    It looks as if at least speed=6 would be possible on a 900 MHz Pentium III.
    If speed is to large, cdrecord's input fifo gets empty (as
    shown by cdrecord) and then you have a buffer underrun.

- replace the wayplay command with something which alerts you if you
  have to change CDROMS

- for restore or verification  replace /dev/cdrom by something
  which applies for you (device for the CDreader)


DON'T FORGET  to generate a boot-CD which has the 0.4b24 restore
  or a newer version of restore on board

I prefer timos_Rescue_Cd_Set-0.6.1  see  http://rescuecd.sourceforge.net
