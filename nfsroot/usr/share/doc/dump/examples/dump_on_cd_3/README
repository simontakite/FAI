I took the dump_on_cd_2/EN/* scripts and merged the pair of scripts into one
script, which checks it's arguments to tell whether or not it is called from
dump and acts accordingly.

The script commandline takes dump arguments except -f (output file/device), -F
(script to run after each volume is finished) and -B (volume size) which are
overridden.

You can use the script to backup to CD with cdrtecord from cdrtools or to
DVD with either cdrtools with DVD support or growisofs from dvd+rw-tools.
You must configure the burning process by adjusting the variables at the top
of the script.
