So you may have a look at the enclosed scripts.

I use rsh in both directions. This may easily be changed to ssh.

Basically three scripts are now necessary. The first wraps around the
dump-command, the second acts as user exit when CD has to be changed
and the third has to be run on the remote box.

To make things easier I put the first two into one file called
dump-to-remote-cd. The second file called get-dumpdata-to-cdrecord must
be copied to the box with the CD-Burner. There is a small
configuration section in it to get cdrecord to work.  

dump-to-remote-cd may be called with the capacity of the media which
is used and / or a filesystem argument passed to dump.

Usage is: 

dump-to-remote-cd [ -c <CD_capacity> ] [files to dump ...]

There are defaults in the scripts which are used if any of these
arguments are missing. The hostname of the box with the CD-burner
has to be edited in any case.

Kind regards
