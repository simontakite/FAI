Description: flexible package manager -- console interface
 This package provides a console interface to Cupt library, which implements
 high-level package manager for Debian and derivatives. Cupt is written with
 flexibility and reliability in mind and uses dpkg as the back-end.
 .
 Cupt uses the same APT infrastructure, e.g. index files, deb cache archive
 files, configuration files. It understands some of widely used APT options.
 .
 Some features:
  - strict full-case resolver;
  - resolver reasons tracking;
  - command-line and 'cupt::*' option name checker;
  - case-sensitive search;
  - pinning by source package name;
  - pinning by package groups using shell-like patterns;
  - configurable 'depends' and 'rdepends' subcommands;
  - 'satisfy' subcommand;
  - support of LZMA-compressed indexes;
  - source versions synchronization;
  - 'shell' subcommand (to get command history, search etc. working, install
    the package 'libreadline6');
  - integration with debdelta (to get it, install the package 'debdelta');
  - system snapshots (needs packages 'dpkg-dev' and 'dpkg-repack').
 .
 Its interface is mostly like apt-get/aptitude console interface.
 .
 Cupt has built-in support for APT repositories using the file:// or copy://
 URL schemas. For access to remote repositories using HTTP or FTP, install a
 download method such as libcupt3-0-downloadmethod-curl.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: ext2/ext3/ext4 file system libraries
 The ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
 ("extended") file system. They are the main file system types used for
 hard disks on Debian and other Linux systems.
 .
 This package provides the ext2fs and e2p libraries, for userspace software
 that directly accesses extended file systems. Programs that use libext2fs
 include e2fsck, mke2fs, and tune2fs. Programs that use libe2p include
 dumpe2fs, chattr, and lsattr.

Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS binaries)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.  It will not automatically install GRUB
 as the active boot loader, nor will it automatically update grub.cfg on
 upgrade, so most people should install grub-pc instead.

Description: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (PC/BIOS version)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
  - VESA-based graphical mode with background image support and complete 24-bit
    color set.
  - Support for extended charsets.  Users can write UTF-8 text to their menu
    entries.
 .
 This package contains a version of GRUB that has been built for use with
 traditional PC/BIOS architecture.

Pre-Depends: libc6 (>= 2.11)
Description: a pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

Description: Low-level tool for generating an initramfs image
 Unlike existing initramfs's, this is an attempt at having as little as
 possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible.  The initramfs has
 (basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that
 we can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
 then when we have the rootfs's device node, we mount and carry on.
 Having the root on MD, LVM2, LUKS is supported as well as NFS, iSCSI,
 NBD and FCOE with dracut-network.

Description: 4.4bsd dump and restore for ext2 filesystems
 Dump examines files on a filesystem and determines which files need to be
 backed up.  These files are copied to the given disk, tape or other storage
 medium for safe keeping.
 .
 The restore command performs the inverse function of dump.  A full backup of
 a file system may be restored and subsequent incremental backups layered on
 top of it.  Single files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or
 partial backups.

Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 sshd replaces the insecure rshd program, which is obsolete for most
 purposes.

Description: SELinux policy management library
 This package provides the shared libraries for SELinux policy management.
 It uses libsepol for binary policy manipulation and libselinux for
 interacting with the SELinux system.  It also exec's helper programs
 for loading policy and for checking whether the file_contexts
 configuration is valid (load_policy and setfiles from
 policycoreutils) presently, although this may change at least for the
 bootstrapping case
 .
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a
 number of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to
 add mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.

Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is a simple NTP client that sets a system's clock to match
 the time obtained by communicating with one or more NTP servers.  It
 is not sufficient, however, for maintaining an accurate clock in the
 long run.  ntpdate by itself is useful for occasionally setting the
 time on machines that do not have full-time network access, such as
 laptops.
 .
 If the full NTP daemon from the package "ntp" is installed, then
 ntpdate is not necessary.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: Administrative utilities for the XFS filesystem
 The xfsdump package contains xfsdump, xfsrestore and a number of
 other administrative utilities for managing XFS filesystems.
 .
 xfsdump examines files in a filesystem, determines which need to be
 backed up, and copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other
 storage medium.  It uses XFS-specific directives for optimizing the
 dump of an XFS filesystem, and also knows how to backup XFS extended
 attributes.  Backups created with xfsdump are "endian safe" and can
 thus be transfered between Linux machines of different architectures
 and also between IRIX machines.
 .
 xfsrestore performs the inverse function of xfsdump; it can restore a
 full backup of a filesystem.  Subsequent incremental backups can then
 be layered on top of the full backup.  Single files and directory
 subtrees may be restored from full or partial backups.

 This package provides the shared libraries for Security-enhanced
 Linux that provides interfaces (e.g. library functions for the
 SELinux kernel APIs like getcon(), other support functions like
 getseuserbyname()) to SELinux-aware applications. Security-enhanced
 Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number of utilities with
 enhanced security functionality designed to add mandatory access
 controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux kernel contains new
 architectural components originally developed to improve the security
 of the Flask operating system. These architectural components provide
 general support for the enforcement of many kinds of mandatory access
 control policies, including those based on the concepts of Type
 Enforcement, Role-based Access Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libselinux1 provides an API for SELinux applications to get and set
 process and file security contexts and to obtain security policy
 decisions.  Required for any applications that use the SELinux
 API. libselinux may use the shared libsepol to manipulate the binary
 policy if necessary (e.g. to downgrade the policy format to an older
 version supported by the kernel) when loading policy.

Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a replacement for sysvinit.  It is dependency-based and
 able to read the LSB init script headers in addition to parsing rcN.d
 links as hints.
 .
 It also provides process supervision using cgroups and the ability to
 not only depend on other init script being started, but also
 availability of a given mount point or dbus service.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/bin/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: Low-level tool for generating an initramfs image
 Unlike existing initramfs's, this is an attempt at having as little as
 possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible.  The initramfs has
 (basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that
 we can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
 then when we have the rootfs's device node, we mount and carry on.
 Having the root on MD, LVM2, LUKS is supported as well as NFS, iSCSI,
 NBD and FCOE with dracut-network.

 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.

 extended to further types as well. Once the storage devices
 are prepared, an appropriate fstab(5) file is generated.
 .
 This package provides the setup-storage utility as separate

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 .
 These declared relations between scripts make it possible to optimize
 the boot sequence for the currently installed set of packages, while
 detecting and rejecting dependency loops.

Description: Asynchronous event notification library
 Libevent is an asynchronous event notification library that provides a
 mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs
 on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached.
 .
 It is meant to replace the asynchronous event loop found in
 event driven network servers. Currently, libevent supports /dev/poll,
 kqueue(2), event ports, select(2), poll(2) and epoll(4).
 .
 For backward compatibility and to transition to "libevent_core only"
 or "libevent_core + libevent_extra", the libevent source package builds
 the libevent library that includes everything in libevent_core and
 libevent_extra.

 /etc/deluser.conf 773fb95e98a27947de4a95abb3d3f2a2
Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .

Description: Sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP/BitTorrent client programs
 Lftp is a file retrieving tool that supports FTP, HTTP, FISH, SFTP, HTTPS,
 FTPS and BitTorrent protocols under both IPv4 and IPv6. Lftp has an amazing
 set of features, while preserving its interface as simple and easy as possible.
 .
 The main two advantages over other ftp clients are reliability and ability
 to perform tasks in background. It will reconnect and reget the file being
 transferred if the connection broke. You can start a transfer in background
 and continue browsing on the ftp site. It does this all in one process. When
 you have started background jobs and feel you are done, you can just exit
 lftp and it automatically moves to nohup mode and completes the transfers.
 It has also such nice features as reput and mirror. It can also download a
 file as soon as possible by using several connections at the same time.
 .
 Lftp can also be scriptable, it can be used to mirror sites, it lets you
 copy files among remote servers (even between FTP and HTTP). It has an
 extensive online help. It supports bookmarks, and connecting to several
 ftp/http sites at the same time.
 .
 This package also includes lftpget - A simple non-interactive
 tool for downloading files.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: minimalistic Netlink communication library
 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: system interface for user-level packet capture
 libpcap (Packet CAPture) provides a portable framework for low-level
 network monitoring.  Applications include network statistics collection,
 security monitoring, network debugging, etc.

 Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface for
 packet capture, and since there are several tools that require this
 functionality, the libpcap authors created this system-independent API
 to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for several
 system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.
