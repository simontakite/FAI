Description: Low-level tool for generating an initramfs image
 Unlike existing initramfs's, this is an attempt at having as little as
 possible hard-coded into the initramfs as possible.  The initramfs has
 (basically) one purpose in life -- getting the rootfs mounted so that
 we can transition to the real rootfs.  This is all driven off of
 device availability.  Therefore, instead of scripts hard-coded to do
 various things, we depend on udev to create device nodes for us and
 then when we have the rootfs's device node, we mount and carry on.
 Having the root on MD, LVM2, LUKS is supported as well as NFS, iSCSI,
 NBD and FCOE with dracut-network.

Description: Fully Automatic Installation server package
 FAI is a non-interactive system to install, customize and manage
 Linux systems and software configurations on computers as well as
 virtual machines and chroot environments, from small networks to
 large infrastructures and clusters.
 .
 It's a tool for mass unattended Linux installation. You can take one
 or more virgin systems, turn on the power, and after a few minutes,
 the systems are installed, and completely configured to your exact
 needs, without any interaction necessary.
 .
 This package is needed for setting up a FAI install server for network
 installations, for running the dirinstall in a chroot environment, and
 to build installation CD/DVD's and USB sticks.

Description: automatically prepare storage devices
 Using FAI disk_config files, setup-storage computes effective
 partition and volume sizes and executes the necessary commands
 to configure storage devices. It manages disk drives as well
 as RAID and LVM volumes. It handles all file systems supported
 by parted(8) as well as ntfs but is flexible enough to be
 extended to further types as well. Once the storage devices
 are prepared, an appropriate fstab(5) file is generated.
 .
 This package provides the setup-storage utility as separate
 package so it can be used independent from FAI as well.
